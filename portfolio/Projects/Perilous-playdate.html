    <p>Perilous Playdate</p>
    <a class="main-text fade-in"><p>This was made at uni for the Integrated Project 3 model. We got a client who wanted
    a squid game style VR multiplayer game. So we discussed to do children playschool games and the games we chose to
    try to implement was the what's The Time Mr Wolf, glass bridge, duck duck goose games. In the end we only
      got the first two game implemented.</p></a>
    <a class="sub-text fade-in"><p>The story of the game is that you trapped inside a little girl's nightmare, and
      you have to play a series of games so you can escape. The first game was based on the
      What's The Time Mr Wolf game, where you have to get to the end of the lane and grab a bone
      and try to get back and drop the bone into the grave, all without getting caught by the wolf. The second
      game which was based from the glass bridge game, is where you have to try to get to the different
      islands without trying to fall. While the tiles disappear after being stepped on a couple of times.</p></a>

    <a class="roles fade-in"><p>My Role was a programmer, I set up the GitHub so we could collaborate efficiently,
      manage versions, and track our project's progress. So we brainstorm game ideas, and we decided to start on the
      What's The Time Mr Wolf game. I worked on the item spawning at the end of the lane and getting the VR hands to grab the item.
      After that I worked on the player death script for when the player gets caught by the wolf.</P>
      <p> We did a few tests with multiplayer at university's VR lab and at home. I decided to work on the second game,
        which was the glass bridge game.
      [game2: (changed to work on game 2)] added multiplayer, fixed gravity when stepped on glass, worked on the glass panel script, glass panel reset, added a bottom platform and fix teleport gate collider, added glass panel change material function, added audio, made a ghost player, moved the hub to main glass brige scene,
      [other:] glass tile change from colour to cracked tile mesh]  </p></a>
